# Lung_cancer_Detection_with_CNN
# What I Did:
In this project, I built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the classification of lung cancer images, specifically using VGG16 through transfer learning. The goal was to classify CT scan images into three categories: Benign, Malignant, and Normal. I used the IQ-OTHNCCD dataset, which contains 120 benign, 561 malignant, and 416 normal images.
# Key steps in the project:
1.	Dataset Overview: I worked with a medical image dataset with three classes.
2.	CNN Architecture: I designed a custom CNN model using Conv2D layers, batch normalization, max pooling, and dense layers to extract features from images. I also used dropout regularization to prevent overfitting.
3.	Transfer Learning: I fine-tuned the VGG16 model, freezing its feature extraction layers and adding custom dense layers. This approach achieved a high test accuracy of 98.1%.
4.	Model Evaluation: I evaluated the models using precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix. VGG16 outperformed other models in terms of accuracy and robustness.
# Problem:
The project aimed to address the challenge of detecting lung cancer using CT scans and deep learning techniques. Traditional diagnostic methods often require expert radiologists and may have limitations in resource-constrained environments. The problem was to assess whether CNN models, especially using transfer learning with pre-trained models like VGG16, could be used to automate lung cancer detection with high accuracy.
# Insights:
1.	High Accuracy with Transfer Learning: The VGG16 model, after fine-tuning, achieved 98.1% accuracy on the test dataset, with high precision and recall across all classes. This indicates that CNNs are highly effective in classifying medical images, even with a relatively small dataset.
2.	Comparison to Traditional Methods: CNNs, especially VGG16, demonstrated superior performance compared to traditional diagnostic methods, offering higher accuracy and robust classification with minimal misclassifications.
3.	Effectiveness in Resource-Limited Areas: The model can play a significant role in improving healthcare accessibility, especially in areas with limited access to trained radiologists or diagnostic equipment. CNN-based systems can reduce reliance on manual interpretation, speeding up diagnosis in under-resourced settings.
4.	Differentiation between Benign and Malignant Nodules: The VGG16 model was able to effectively differentiate between benign and malignant lung nodules, showing promise in early detection and treatment planning.
# Recommendations:
1.	Adoption in Healthcare Systems: Given the high performance of CNN-based models, particularly VGG16, I recommend integrating automated lung cancer detection systems in clinical environments, especially in regions with limited access to specialists.
2.	Further Optimization: While VGG16 performed well, further fine-tuning and training on larger, more diverse datasets could improve model accuracy even further. Experimenting with other architectures like VGG19 or ResNet could also provide insights into better models.
3.	Deployment for Screening: Using this model as a screening tool in medical facilities could speed up the diagnosis process and help identify lung cancer at earlier stages, potentially saving lives.
4.	Expand Data Sources: To enhance model generalization, I suggest using datasets from multiple sources and increasing the variety of CT scan images for better model robustness.
